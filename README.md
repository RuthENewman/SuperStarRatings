# SuperStarRatings - https://ruthenewman.github.io/SuperStarRatings/

Day 10 of challenge to complete 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (film ratings app awarding up to 5 'stars')

A vanilla JS web application with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css). The app works by selecting a film from 
the dropdown list at the top, and amending the rating pre-populated in the form by a degree of 0.1 or higher. Once updated, it updates the
table below accordingly.

Currently this project is front-end only, and therefore resets ratings on a refresh.
